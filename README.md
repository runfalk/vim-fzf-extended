Vim FZF Extended
================
This is a collection of my own FZF Vim customizations. They are tested on both
Vim 8 and Neovim.


Commands
--------
- `FZFBuffers` - select and search open buffers.
- `FZFFiles` - Modified version of `FZF` that shows hidden files, but ignores
  noise like `.git/`, `.DS_Store`, `*.pyc`, etc.
- `FZFDefinitions` - Navigate function, method and class definitions within the
  current buffer. (Requires ctags)


`FZFDefinitions` - Supported languages
--------------------------------------
- Python
- Vim script
